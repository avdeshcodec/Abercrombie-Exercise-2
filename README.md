Exercise 2: Task Tracker Enhancement

## Below are major key points which I have done in the excercise:
- Fixed issues of HTML, CSS & JavaScript and implemented all the features mentioned in the exercise.
- Used gulp to compile sass to css.
- Created `storage.js`s file to manage all the localstorage related work.
- All tracker app related methods are written in `app.js`.
- Used pure Vanilla JavaScript for exercise.
- Used flex layout to avoid media queries and did some styling to make UI more user frendly.
- Created a node server using express to serve application files on port 3000.
- I have added comments to provide the information about methods.

## Below are the steps to run the application:
- Run `npm i` to install node modules
- Run `npm run scss` to compile Scss
- Run `npm start` to launch server
- Navigate to browser and open url `http://localhost:3000`
